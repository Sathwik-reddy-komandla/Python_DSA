Anlalyzing thealgorithms complexity and run times 

==>
initial size N

iteration 1:
    size =initial/2 => N/2

iteration 2:    
    size= initial/4=>N/4


iteration k:
    size= initial/2^k => N/2^k

=>Final length = 1 => (N/2^k) =1
                   => N=2^k
                   => k=log(N) >to the base 2

space complecity => O(1)
